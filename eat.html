                    Classics with a modern twist are the name of the game in this former apothecarys shop with a canal
                    view. Spread across several rooms boasting simple yet tasteful décor, there’s an understated
                    elegance to everything here, from the food to the imported marble tabletops.<br><br>Whether it’s the
                    turbot, pea ravioli or sumptuous Jansz burger, chef Arnout van der Kolk’s cooking is robust and
                    flavourful, and while dinner is the real star, they also do a mean lunch and happily cater for kids.
                    This is the freshest Dutch produce at its very best.

                    Manneken Pis on the Damrak is famous for its Flemish fries, actually made from Dutch potatoes. After
                    one bite, you'll be in fry heaven. The schanulleke is a perfect snack size portion, while urbanus is
                    better for lunch. The obelix is absolutely gigantic, weighing almost a kilo, and is best if you have
                    a large appetite or are planning to share with friends.<br><br>You can also add sauces. The Dutch
                    typically eat their fries with mayonnaise, but you have approximately 20 different sauces to choose
                    from, such as ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, garlic sauce, cheddar cheese and tartar sauce.<br><br>You
                    can also try the "special fries," with mayonnaise, curry sauce and onions, or the "fry war" topped
                    with mayonnaise, peanut sauce and onions. Manneken Pis is open until 2:00 a.m. on Fridays and
                    Saturdays, so you can drop by for a late-night snack.
