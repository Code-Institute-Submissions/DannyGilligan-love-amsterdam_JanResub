# Love Amsterdam

The Love Amsterdam website is aimed at anyone who is undertaking a trip on short notice to Amsterdam and needs a quick list of places where they can stay, eat and go to make the most of their time in this wonderful city!

Users of the Love Amsterdam website will find a curated list of hotels, restaurants and venues that are ideal for travellers who are here for a short stay. The aim of the site is to provide a 'screened' list of venues that can be ranked high in 4 main categories: Quality, Accessibility, Availability and Reliability.

## Features

* **Navigation**

  *  At the top of each page across the site, a navigation menu allows the user to quickly and conveniently access the information they need, such as, 'Where to Stay', 'Where to Eat' and 'Where to Go'.

  * The navigation options are clear and include visual clues upon hovering over the links to emphasise the user interactivity, and an orange underlined border will be displayed on the page the user is currenlty active on.

* **Testing**
  * The site was tested on various browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and devices (laptop, mobile phone, tablet) and functioned as expected.
  * The project is responsive across different devices, however a bug has been identified with the navigation bar on smaller screens. This is in the process of being resolve, however, due to the proximity to the project deadline, it has not been fixed before deployment.
  * The form works as expected, required fields are enforced along with a tip letting the user know if a field has not been filled in, the 'Send Message' button is linked to the Code Institute form dump page.
  
 ***
 
 * **Bugs**

Solved Bugs
  * During the coding process, the code was tested with the HTML and CSS validators, errors were identified and resolved based on the output from the validation.
  * I encountered an issue when making the 'main menu' options responsive on smaller screens, they would not display correctly, however, once they were displayed using 'flex' and with a direction of 'column', the issue was resolved.
  
Unsolved Bugs
  * The navigation bar has lost responsiveness on smaller screen sizes, I am currently investigating this issue, however it will not be fixed in time for the deployment deadline.
